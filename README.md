# List open hangout spots

This handy little app checks the current time against the
(caf√©, bar, library, etc.) hours listed in hangouts.json and
prints names of places that are open. It's smart enough to
correctly handle:

 * Varying hours by day of week
 * Summer hours (or any date range for which hours are
   different)
 * Places open past midnight (e.g., 4pm-2am)

Some limitations:

 * No geographical info / distance calculation
 * Doesn't warn you if place is "open", but closing in 5
   minutes
 * You have to manually edit a JSON file to change the data
   (hangouts.txt contains an idea for a friendlier format
   that is not yet used)

I wrote this to suggest places I can bring my laptop and
hack instead of sitting at home. The sample hangouts.json
file consists of cool wifi-enabled places near me in
Minneapolis, MN.
